## ðŸ¤–Introduction
Through the development of this project, I have acquired valuable hands-on experience in the art of crafting websites utilizing ReactJS for frontend development. This project represents a significant milestone as my second venture into ReactJS, and it has allowed me to delve deeper into the advantages of leveraging High-Order Components (HOC). Implementing HOCs has proven to be instrumental in achieving code reusability, allowing for a more modular and organized structure in handling multiple files, particularly those associated with API coding. This experience has not only enriched my technical proficiency but has also instilled a keen understanding of the pivotal role that strategic code structuring plays in the creation of robust and scalable web applications.

## ðŸš¨Tutorial
I want to credit [JavaScriptMastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oV65GVVits) for providing a video demonstration and its effectiveness in understanding how to use these TechStack technologies and continuing learning from JavaScript Mastery  

## ðŸ’»Technologies
- React.js
- Vite


## ðŸ”‹Features
- React functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental #CSS properties to master flex & grid
